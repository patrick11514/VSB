# ✨ VAJ - Frontend

This is the frontend of the **VAJ** project, built with **React 19**, **Vite**, and styled using **TailwindCSS**. It leverages modern tools to ensure a fast, responsive, and maintainable web experience. 🚀

---

## 📦 Installation

We recommend using **pnpm** for managing dependencies.

If you don't have **pnpm** installed, run:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then, install project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

---

## 🛠️ Development

To start the development server, use:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This launches the app at `http://localhost:5173`. If this port is taken, Vite will automatically choose the next available one (e.g., `http://localhost:5174`).

---

## 🏗️ Build

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
pnpm build
```
