## LAB Excercise

Download Postman so it's easier to send requests to the server. Postman https://www.postman.com/downloads/
(or if you know any other tool, you can use that)

As with cloning any JS project, first run `npm install` to install all the dependencies listed in `package.json` file -- look into the file to see what dependencies are being installed.

You can start the project by running `npm run dev` in the terminal. Notice what is specified in `package.json` under dev script. The command `--watch` will automatically restart the server when you make changes to the code.

Notice the Hello World on when you viist http://localhost:3000 or when you make GET request with Postman to http://localhost:3000.
