//! Run this file with `cargo test --test 03_worker_queue`.

//! TODO (2p): implement a simple parallel job queue
//!
//! Implement a struct `WorkerQueue`, which will manage N worker threads.
//! It will allow its users to execute a job on a single worker, and then read the result of that
//! job.
//!
//! ## Creation of the queue
//! The queue should offer a `new` associated function, which will receive the number of workers
//! in the queue, along with the size of a queue for each individual workers.
//! For example, if you execute `WorkerQueue::new(4, 2)`, then four worker threads should be
//! spawned, and each worker thread should have its own queue of size (bound) of `2`.
//!
//! ## Jobs
//! It will be possible to execute a job using the `enqueue` method, which receives something
//! callable that can be executed within a worker.
//! `enqueue` should be callable on a shared reference to the queue.
//!
//! You will need to make sure that the passed function can be safely passed to a worker thread.
//! The queue should be generic over the return type of jobs, all jobs will return the same type.
//!
//! ## Job scheduling
//! Jobs should be scheduled in a trivial round-robin matter.
//! In other words, the first job goes to worker 0, the second to worker 1, the third to worker 2,
//! etc., until you run out of workers and you start from the beginning again.
//! Note that the goal is for the workers to run in parallel, so they should not block each other
//! from executing jobs.
//!
//! ## Reading results
//! The queue should offer a `next_result` method, which will block until the next result is
//! ready. Note that results can "skip ahead" one another, e.g. if you enqueue a job A, and then job
//! B, and job B finishes sooner than job A, then `next_result` should return the result of job B.
//! `next_result` should be callable on a shared reference to the queue.
//!
//! ## Closing of the queue
//! The queue should have a `close` method, which consumes it, drops all resources and waits
//! until all worker threads have terminated.
//!
//! See tests for more details.
//!
//! **DO NOT** use Rayon or any other crate, implement the queue manually using only libstd.
//!
//! TODO(question): is it possible to enqueue work to WorkerQueue from multiple threads?
//! Try it and see what happens. If it's not possible, how could you make it work?
//!
//! Currently no, because I use Cell, which can be replaced by RwLock, but then still the struct cannot be sent, because of Receiver, which we don't need,
//! We can solve it similarly as channel does it, to split the queue into read + write part. where write part (enqueue) could be Sendable (eg multiple sources)
//! and the readable part (next_result) will not be sendable.
//!
//! Hint: When writing parallel code, you might run into deadlocks (which will be presented as a
//! "blank screen" with no output and maybe a spinning wheel :) ).
//! If you want to see interactive output during the execution of a test, you can add stderr print
//! statements (e.g. using `eprintln!`) and run tests with `cargo test -- --nocapture`, so that you
//! see the output interactively. Alternatively, you can try to use a debugger (e.g. GDB, LLDB or
//! GDB/LLDB integrated within an IDE).
