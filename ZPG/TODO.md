- [x] Mouse control
- [x] Transformations using composite + correct multiply
- [x] Share points between same objects
- [x] go through code, add consts + cleanup
- [x] update projectionMatrix when resize
- [x] fix up vector to face 0,1,0 instead of 0,-1,0
- [x] when viewport changers, update it, and call camera update to sync shaders
- [x] add remaining light methods
- [ ] add support for more lights
  - [ ] Light will be between base object in scene
  - [ ] Method for getting all lights (temporarily first, until we add support for more)
- [x] don't lock cursor and don't move every time, only if mrb is pressed
- [x] ShaderProgram methods: updateModelMatrix(Transformations&) etc..
- [ ] Light, camera could be something like Drawable object
  - [x] Create BaseObject
  - [x] Rename object to DrawableObject
  - [ ] Camera should inherit from BaseObject
    - [ ] Normal Camera will interit from baseobject
    - [ ] Camera should be removed from separated field, but between baseobjects
    - [ ] Camera should have enable attribute, to be able to swap between them
    - [ ] GetCamera function should then return first enabled camera (only one should have enabled)
  - [ ] Light should inherit from BaseObject
- [x] Window as separated class
- [x] Dynamic transformations
